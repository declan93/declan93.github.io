Tipperary native first and foremost with an interest in computational biology. 
I am a current PhD student in Prof. Cathal Seoighes research group at NUI Galway, working on inferring the underlying effects of somatic mutations in relatively healthy populations such as the UK Biobank. I completed my undergraduated in biotechnology (2016) and MSc in Biomedical Genomics (2018) both at NUIG. I spent 3 months of my third year in Vannes, Brittany charactering the biochemical makeup of the burdensome *Solieria Chordalis* which plagues the beaches of the northwest of France. For my undergraduate final year project I worked on trying to find variants associated with memory formation and schizophrenia under the supervision of Derek Morris. Coming from a "wet lab" undergraduate degree my final year project thought me that biological research was solely pippettemans and tedious protocols. My masters thesis involved using simplistic methods to try and infer somatic mutation rates from population sequencing data and undercover germline variants that impact on the inferred somatic mutation rate. \ After graduating from my MSc (2018) I worked as a Bioinformatician at EMBL-EBI for the AMP-T2D project. My work on the AMP-T2D project mainly consisted of generating GWAS pipelines and pushing association statistics to the federated knowledge base at EMBL-EBI. The federated node at the EBI allowed for European genetic data to be housed within Europe and summary level data to be shared to the knwoledge portal hosted at the Broad institute. 


I returned to Galway to undertake a Irish research council funded PhD scholarship working somatic mutations from population sequencing projects. In 2020 I moved from the IRC post to an Science foundation Ireland PhD scholarship within the same research group. During My PhD I have been acting as a defacto System administrator for two high performance compute clusters and all the fun that goes along with HPC administration. In 2019, I was awarded a \euro 25000 grant to contribute to a new high perfomance filesystem (250TB usuable storage). In the first year of my PhD I was a TA for probablistic modelling for molecular biology. This course covered topics such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and models of DNA evolution (Jukes & Cantor, Kimura's 2 parameter model,General time reversible etc...).
