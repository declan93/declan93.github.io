Before starting my PhD, I had a loose plan that I would like to return to Sydney to work in the Children's Hospital in Randwick. The pipe dream of returning to live near Centennial Park was short-lived but the eventual specialisation in paediatric cancer genomics remained. After completing my PhD, my supervisor introduced me to a past student of his who is now a principal investigator at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis renowned for the birth of Rock'n'Roll and Blues B.B. King & Elvis Presley may not have been initially on my radar but I had a good working knowledge of St Jude in terms of their research and their Cloud platform developed for sharing (Anonymised & summarised) and analysing genetic information collected through their various projects. After presenting an online seminar to the computational biology department, I headed for Beale St to interview at St Jude in October. Memphis is relatively awkward to get to from Ireland with no direct flights from Ireland. The flight options include changing in JFK, O'Hare or Atlanta with some flights routing through Amsterdam. The words of Tom T. Hall were stuck in my head the whole journey  {% include pullquote.html quote="I haven't eaten a bite
