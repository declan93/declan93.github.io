Reverie is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog.


## The name?

reverie - _a state of being pleasantly lost in one's thoughts; a daydream._<br><sup>/ˈrɛv(ə)ri/</sup>
