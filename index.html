  <h2>About</h2>
  <p> This website is rarely updated and is very much a work in progress. <\p> 
    <p> I am computational biologist / bioinformatician, interested in applying evolutionary and genetic variation techniques to understand and inform genomic health. 
      I have extensive experience with working with population-scale genetic datasets.
    <p>A brief overview of my background can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Bio">here.</a>
