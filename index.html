  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I have recently submitted my PhD thesis in Prof. Cathal Seoighes research group at NUI Galway. 
      I completed my undergraduated in biotechnology (2016) and MSc in Biomedical Genomics (2018) both at NUIG. 
      My masters thesis involved using simplistic methods to try and infer somatic mutation rates from population sequencing data.
      I worked as a Bioinformatician (2018) at EMBL-EBI for the AMP-T2D project. My work on the AMP-T2D project mainly consisted of generating GWAS
      pipelines and pushing association statistics to the federated knowledge base at EMBL-EBI.</p>
